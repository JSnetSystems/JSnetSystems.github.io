### About me and this site

I'm currenly working as a z/OS adminstrator and enjoy working and learning on the mainframe platform. I also enjoy working in Linux and Windows enviroment as well and do some develpoment work from time to time to try out the latest and greatest to keep up with the ever changing technology world. As I discover things of interest I will post them on this blog site which I created. 

Keeping with learning new things I started this site using {{< link "https://gohugo.io/" HUGO >}} framework and Githubs Pages as the hosting site and after some github setup it gets automatically deployed once updates are made to this site.
