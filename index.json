[{"categories":["Mainframe"],"content":"FIND Picture String A nice option to the find command that comes in handy is the picture string. I like to use it to find error messages in logs for my normal daily health checks. There are several characters types to choose from. While in the SYSLOG or any output you can enter these command examples to find errors. Example: Go into the SYSLOG and max to bottom of log This example will find any errors starting with the EQQ characters followed by any 4 characters and ending with a letter E going backwards in the SYSLOG. COMMAND ===\u003e FIND P‚ÄôEQQ====E' prev This example will find any messages starting with HASP followed by any 2 digits and ending with 5. Perhaps not useful but you get the idea. COMMAND ===\u003e FIND P‚ÄôHASP##5' prev Some other options types to use. Equal-sign (=) Any character (don‚Äôt care) Not-sign (¬¨) Any non-blank character Period (.) Any non-display (invalid) character Sharp (#) Any numeric character (digit) Minus-sign (-) Any non-numeric character At-sign (@) Any alphabetic character Less-than Any lower case alphabetic character Greater-than Any upper case alphabetic character Dollar-sign ($) Any special character ","date":"2022-01-11","objectID":"/posts/find-post/:1:0","tags":["z/OS","FIND","SEARCH"],"title":"Find Picture String","uri":"/posts/find-post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"About me and this site I‚Äôm currenly working as a z/OS adminstrator and enjoy working and learning on the mainframe platform.
